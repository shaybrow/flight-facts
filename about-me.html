          Jason Quaglia
        </h5>
        <p>Hello, my name is Jason Quaglia and I'm a 26 year old student at CodeFellows. I currently live in downtown Seattle with my girlfriend Katie and our dog Bentley. I'm an avid lover of technology and I love to tinker with electronics. I like to build computers and even build my own mechanical keyboards. I also love to go outside and hike, camp, and snowboard! I grew up in upstate New York and after a year of not knowing what I wanted to do in college, I decided it wasn't right for me at the time. I decided to move to Truckee, California to get some life experience and after living there for 5 years, Katie and I decided to move to Seattle in search of careers. This is where I decided to enroll at Code Fellows.</p>
        <p>I'm an organized, punctual worker with a knack for troubleshooting. My whole life I've been known as the person who helps you fix things. I've decided to take this and run with it in the hopes of becoming a great software developer. I was instilled with a love for technology from a young age (my dad was a software developer) and I am looking for a position/company that will help me grow and learn to hone my natural problem solving ability. My friends and family believe in me and I owe it to them to give it a shot.</p>
