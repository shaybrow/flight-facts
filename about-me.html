        <p>Hello, my name is Jason Quaglia and I'm a 26 year old student at CodeFellows. I currently live in downtown
          Seattle with my girlfriend Katie and our dog Bentley. I'm an avid lover of technology and I love to tinker
          with electronics. I like to build computers and even build my own mechanical keyboards. I also love to go
          outside and hike, camp, and snowboard! I grew up in upstate New York and after a year of not knowing what I
          wanted to do in college, I decided it wasn't right for me at the time. I decided to move to Truckee,
          California to get some life experience and after living there for 5 years, I decided to move to
          Seattle in search of a career. This is where I decided to enroll at Code Fellows.</p>
        <p>I'm an organized, punctual worker with a knack for troubleshooting. My whole life I've been known as the
          person who helps you fix things. I've decided to take this and run with it in the hopes of becoming a great
          software developer.</p>

        <p id="paragraph">Before I dove into the tech world I'd worked a host of different jobs, primarily in customer
          service. I
          enjoyed solving problems for and assisting my customers but the same problems on repeat left me less engaged
          than I'd like. I'd had previous experience managing Trayvax.com on the Shopify platform and thoroughly enjoyed
          implementing apps to make the site more engaging to our customers. I knew that software development required
          constant
          problem solving and that problem solving has been my greatest passion professionally. I find client and
          customer feedback an excellent inspiration to create better experiences and I'd love to integrate that passion
          into my work as a developer. </p>
