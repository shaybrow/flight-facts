## Vision

We aim to deliver an engaging app that quizzes the user on their knowledge of various countries around the world. This app will help our users learn more about us and the world in which they live. You can use this app to learn some fun facts about places you’ve probably never been to before.

### Scope - IN

Users are prompted for their handle which is stored and saved for interaction
Users are taken around the world through various visual aids and text prompts.
Users are asked trivia about each location and are informed of the answer if they’re incorrect
Users can click a link to learn about the creators of the game
When the game is completed a scoreboard is displayed with user’s name

### Scope - OUT

This website will never be optimised for mobile
This app will never save scores across different computers

### MVP

A functional trivia game that confirms correct answers or provides correct answer if user provided them wrong 
User is provided visual cues to share a small story about the country they’re visiting 
User provides a handle which is stored locally 
Upon completing the game user’s score is displayed on a scoreboard along with their handle, this score is also stored locally
3 question types: t/f, multiple choice, fill in the blank

- link to about me and scoreboard page

### Stretch Goals

Animation for traveling to each country
Multiple questions for each country
Difficulty options affecting submission type for questions
If user attempts to navigate away from page while game is active, display alert informing them progress will be lost if they leave page
Hide then display scoreboard
Reviews and comments can be left on scoreboard
Game over logic

### Functional Requirements

A user can play the flight facts game to completion
A user can easily navigate between all pages on the site
A user can return later on the same computer and see their score displayed 

### Data Flow

When the user enters the site for the first time they are prompted for their username. This string is stored in an array of all usernames. The user then has the option of starting the game, checking the leaderboard and checking out the creator’s about me page. If they navigate to the leaderboard or about me page they can navigate back and their username will still be saved. As they play the game their score will be added to and displayed at the end. They will also be prompted to go to the leaderboard if they wish to see how they stack up. Their saved score would be added to the existing leaderboard.

## Leaderboard

Leaderboard should be separately iterated through to be ordered in highest to lowest and saved to localStorage upon loading the webpage for the first time and then anytime the leaderboard array on app.js is updated. Leaderboard.js will load the leaderboard array from localStorage then use DOM manipulation to render an ordered list onto the page with the most updated list of scores.
